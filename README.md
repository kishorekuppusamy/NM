Sentiment Analysis for Marketing
Overview
This project is a demonstration of sentiment analysis applied to marketing-related content. Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding customer opinions and feedback, which can help businesses make informed decisions regarding their products, services, and marketing strategies. In this project, we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on marketing data.

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Python: You'll need Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Required Python libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

pip install nltk

Data: Prepare your marketing-related text data for analysis. This could include customer reviews, social media mentions, product descriptions, or any other text related to your marketing efforts.
How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Customize the sentiment_analysis.py script to use your own marketing data. You can change the text variable to the text you want to analyze.

Run the Python script by executing:

The script will output the analyzed text, the sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral), and the compound sentiment score.
